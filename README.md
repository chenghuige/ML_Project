# Machine Learning Project
 
This is where I place my personal projects, these are several projects that I have finished so far:

## Computer Vision   

### 1. [Semantic Segmentation in Seismic Images](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Seismic%20Segmentation)   
This is semantic segmentation project to delineate salt bodies in seismic images with U-Net Architecture with Resnet18 and Resnet34

### 2. [Mineral Image Classification](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Mineral_Image_Classification)   
I classify 7 mineral classes and produce robust model that can be used to classify minerals, I've tried it using mineral images from google

### 3. [COVID-19 X-ray Classification](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/COVID-19%20X-ray)    
This project aimed to identify covid-19 from x-ray images as early detection to help physician

### 5. [Text Extraction](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Text%20Extraction)   
Save your reading time while machine extracts important sentences and make summary from PDF file, using TF-IDF as weight for each word in sentences and return the highes score as summary and save your time.  

## Other topics   

### 6. [Air Quality Data Exploration](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Air_Quality)    
Simple tabular data exploration, and build simple linear model to predict air quality index   

### 7. [Feed Forward Neural Network](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Neural%20Net)   
Build Deep Neural Network architecture to predict Housing Price and classifying Fashion MNIST datasets   

### 8. [Land Cover Classification from NDVI Value](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/land_cover_NDVI)
Data Exploration and do some features selection to classify land cover base on its NDVI values
