# Machine Learning Project
 
This is where I place my personal projects, these are several projects that I have finished:

### 1. [Mineral Image Classification](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Mineral_Image_Classification)   
I classify 7 mineral classes and produce rebust model that can be used to classify minerals, I've tried it using mineral images from google  

### 2. [COVID-19 X-ray Classification](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/COVID-19%20X-ray)    
This project aimed to indentify covid-19 from x-ray images as early detection to help physician

### 3. [Sentiment Analysis COVID-19](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20Covid-19)   
This Project about classify sentiment from scarapped twitter tweet using private data   

### 4. [Air Quality Data Exploration](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Air_Quality)    
Simple tabular data exploration, and build simple linear model to predict air quality index   

### 5. [Feed Forward Neural Network](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/Neural%20Net)   
Build Deep Neural Network architecture to predict Housing Price and classifying Fashion MNIST datasets   

### 6. [Land Cover Classification from NDVI Value](https://github.com/said-rasidin/ML_Project/tree/master/land_cover_NDVI)
Data Exploration and do some features selection to classify land cover base on its NDVI values
